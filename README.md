# 🧠 JavaScript Practice Repository

Welcome to my **JavaScript Practice Repository**!  
This repo contains all my daily practice work, exercises, and mini-projects that I’m doing to strengthen my **JavaScript fundamentals** on my journey to becoming a **Full Stack Developer**.

## 🚀 About This Repository
This repository is my daily coding log —  
I’m practicing and pushing everything I learn in JavaScript here, including:
- Core language concepts (Variables, Functions, Loops, Arrays, Objects)
- DOM Manipulation
- Async JavaScript (Promises, Async/Await, Fetch API)
- Small to Medium JS Projects

My goal is to become **internship-ready by December 2025** 💪
